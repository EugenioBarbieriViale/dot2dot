# dot2dot
Fun game written that you can play with anyone! The WebSocket server is my personal computer, for this reason it will hardly be possible to play.

## How to play
- you can erase dots only in rows
- click on one dot, then on another one, and all the dots in between are going to be erased
- click twice to erase one dot only
- the last player to erase any dots, loses!
